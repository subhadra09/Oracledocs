ORA-01555: snapshot too old: rollback segment number string with name "string" too small
Cause: Rollback records needed by a reader for consistent read are overwritten by other writers.
Action: If in Automatic Undo Management mode, increase the setting of UNDO_RETENTION. Otherwise, use larger rollback segments.

This error can be the result of there being insufficient rollback segments.

A query may not be able to create the snapshot because the rollback data is not available. This can happen when there are many transactions that are modifying data, and performing commits and rollbacks. Rollback data is overwritten when the rollback segments are too small for the size and number of changes that are being performed.

To correct this problem, make more larger rollback segments available. Your rollback data for completed transactions will be kept longer.

Option #2
This error can be the result of programs not closing cursors after repeated FETCH and UPDATE statements.

To correct this problem, make sure that you are closing cursors when you no longer require them.

Option #3
This error can occur if a FETCH is executed after a COMMIT is issued.

The number of rollback records created since the last CLOSE of your cursor will fill the rollback segments and you will begin overwriting earlier records.



ORA-19815:




ORA-06510:Error is related to the code. As the error is not being reported often, we can disregard it.

Description
When you encounter an ORA-06510 error, the following error message will appear:

ORA-06510: unhandled user-defined exception
Cause
You tried to execute a block of code that raised a user-defined exception, but there was no exception block code to handle this exception.

Resolution
The option(s) to resolve this Oracle error are:

Option #1
Remove the user-defined exception from the code.


Description
When you encounter an ORA-06510 error, the following error message will appear:

ORA-06510: unhandled user-defined exception
Cause
You tried to execute a block of code that raised a user-defined exception, but there was no exception block code to handle this exception.




The ORA-07445 is a very generic error, OS dependent, and almost always requires logging a service request (SR) with Oracle Technical support on MOSC. 

See MOSC Note 153788.1 titled "Troubleshoot an ORA-600 or ORA-7445 Error Using the Error Lookup Tool" to find the details for your error.

In general, an "exception" is an un-trapped error, such as dividing a number by zero.  The docs note:

Error: ORA-07445 exception encountered: core dump

Cause : An operating system exception occurred which should result in the creation of a core file. This is an internal error.

Action : Contact Oracle Customer Support.

Common precipitators of the ORA-07445 include:

High volume user transactions
 
Software bugs (i.e. Bug 4098853).  See note 342443.1 on MOSC.
 
Too-small RAM regions (shared_pool_size, java pool, large_pool_size), and a too-small application memory stack (e.g. PL/SQL array too small)
 
Too small undo and temp segments
 
Program errors (addressing outside of RAM region), e.g. S0C4.
 
Improper NLS parameter settings
 
Hardware errors
 
Oracle block corruption

and a host of other related issues. 
Oracle DBA's use alert mechanisms to send an e-mail to the DBA when ORA-07445 errors occur, e-mailing the associated core dump file.  MOSC now offers an ORA-7445 search tool, as described in MOSC note Note:208922.1, and you can supply details from the Oracle trace file to see the exact cause. 

Other common causes of the ORA-07445 include:


 ORA-48170: unable to lock file - already in use
 
 
To check job status:
col OWNER for a20 
col JOB_NAME for a25
col ACTUAL_START_DATE for a30
col ADDITIONAL_INFO for a25
col STATUS for a20
select OWNER,JOB_NAME,STATUS,ERROR#,ACTUAL_START_DATE,ADDITIONAL_INFO from  ALL_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS where JOB_NAME='JSCUTL1' order by ACTUAL_START_DATE;
